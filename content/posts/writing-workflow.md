My workflow is intentionally boring:

1. Create a new Markdown file in `content/posts/`.
2. Add a clear title and one-sentence description.
3. Keep the draft small and ship quickly.

Then GitHub Actions builds and deploys automatically.

The system stays out of the way, which makes it easier to keep writing.
