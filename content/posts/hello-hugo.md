This is the first post on a new static blog.

The goal is simple: write in Markdown, publish quickly, keep maintenance low.

Why Hugo:

- Very fast builds
- Straightforward content model
- Built-in support for sitemap and RSS

The rest of this site follows the same philosophy: only the pieces that matter.
